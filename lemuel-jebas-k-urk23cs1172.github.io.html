<br>
<pre style="font-size: large;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
    The history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> originated in the efforts of scientists and engineers to build and interconnect computer networks. 
    The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States 
    and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.

    Computer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing between computer users, 
    and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. J. C. R. Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the 
    Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). 
    Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet 
    switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in the United Kingdom.
    
    ARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. ARPANET adopted the packet switching 
    technology proposed by Davies and Baran. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, with the design and specification 
    led by Bob Kahn. The host-to-host protocol was specified by a group of graduate students at UCLA, led by Steve Crocker, along with Jon Postel and others. The ARPANET expanded 
    rapidly across the United States with connections to the United Kingdom and Norway.
